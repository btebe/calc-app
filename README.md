## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was not very challenging. i thought the tri-state-toggle would put me in a twist, but when broken down, its very easy.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="tri-state-toggle">
  <input class="btn-theme" type="radio" name="toggle" id="one" />
  <input class="btn-theme" type="radio" name="toggle" id="two" />
  <input class="btn-theme" type="radio" name="toggle" id="three" />
</div>
```

### Continued development

I wish to continue to further challenge my css skills.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://webcodespace.com/how-to-create-a-three-state-toggle-switch-using-html-css-and-javascript) - This helped me understand the tri-toggle-state
